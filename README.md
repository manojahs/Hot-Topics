1)Lazy Loading
------------------
Lazy Loading is a design pattern used to delay the initialization of an object or resource until it is actually needed. This helps improve performance, especially when working with resource-intensive operations or data that may not be required immediately.

Lazy<T> lazyObject = new Lazy<T>(() => new T()); // T is the type of object

Advantages of Lazy Loading:
--------------------------
Improved Performance: Resources are only created when needed, saving time and memory.
Efficiency: Reduces startup time and memory usage when some resources are not required during the program's execution.
Thread-Safety: The Lazy<T> class ensures safe and proper handling of concurrency when multiple threads access the lazy-loaded resource.
