1)Lazy Loading
------------------
Lazy Loading is a design pattern used to delay the initialization of an object or resource until it is actually needed. This helps improve performance, especially when working with resource-intensive operations or data that may not be required immediately.

Lazy<T> lazyObject = new Lazy<T>(() => new T()); // T is the type of object

Advantages of Lazy Loading:
--------------------------
Improved Performance: Resources are only created when needed, saving time and memory.
Efficiency: Reduces startup time and memory usage when some resources are not required during the program's execution.
Thread-Safety: The Lazy<T> class ensures safe and proper handling of concurrency when multiple threads access the lazy-loaded resource.


Polymorphism 
--------------------

Method overloading basically happens in compile time where it happens in same class where multiple methods having same method name with different parameter and it will get called based on the type of arguments that we pass

method overriding basically happens in atleast 2 different class where method name is both the class will be same and child class will be inheriting from base class and main thing is this is a technique where derived class method will get invoked through base class reference variable during run time
